**CorKit** is an open-source Python library designed to streamline the 
retrieval and preprocessing of solar coronagraph data. Its primary aim 
is to democratize access to coronagraph data, enabling a broader community 
of solar scientists to engage in research without the need for proprietary 
software like IDL. It's derived from `Solarsoft <https://www.lmsal.com/solarsoft/>`__:

1. **Open Source Accessibility**: **CorKit** removes barriers to entry by providing 
free access to solar coronagraph data. Its open-source nature ensures that researchers, 
educators, and enthusiasts can easily retrieve and analyze data without worrying about 
proprietary software licenses.

2. **User-Friendly Interface**: With simple and intuitive methods, **CorKit** makes it 
effortless for users to retrieve and preprocess coronagraph data. This user-centric 
approach allows researchers to focus more on their scientific analysis and less on 
navigating complex data retrieval processes.

3. **Advancing Solar Science**: By empowering researchers with the tools needed to 
preprocess and analyze coronagraph data, **CorKit** contributes to the advancement of 
solar science. Researchers can explore the intricate connections between the Sun and Earth, 
leading to new insights and discoveries.
